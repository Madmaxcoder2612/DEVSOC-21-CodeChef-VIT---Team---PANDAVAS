We are working on IOT based water Management System, which also Monitors the quality of the water.Water Management System is totally based on IOT System and it is a self automated system that prevents the overflow of the water ,when the tank or any large storage reservoir is filled completely. This device also alerts the user when the water storage is full and thus it gets automatically turned off the water pump with the relay module. This actually helps to save wastage of precious resources like water and electricity, and give the recent updates on water usage in the societies.

We have Worked on both Hardware and Software of this Project and we are on the way to introduce the power of AI to this System. We have uploaded all the codes that we have designed for this project.

Hello there,

Instructions:

Step-1:

Before opening the Proteus file for the simulation of the model that we have created, please open "WMS_AUTOMATION_RELAY.ino" Arduino code file and Compile it.

Step-2:

After Compiling it, Copy the directory path of the file where it is saved , (usually path is found in the compile window ending with".elf" and ".hex" extensions)

Step-3: After copying it, open the proteus model(do not run the model directly) and double click the arduino Uno and copy the path to the "hex file" section in the Dialog box), after this click apply and okay.

Step-4: Now run the model and here the relay is attached to pin -6 , So after opening the Virtual Terminal option from the Debug Tab, we will get the black Virtual Screen Window, where we can perform the task to give command, So press "F" for speeding fast the motor and "f" to lower the speed of the motor.

thank you.
